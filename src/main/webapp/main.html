		<h4>So this Application can track your Golf Stats?</h4>	
		<p>The golf stat recorder is designed to track any casual player stats when that
		player comes to a course we have in our database. We are looking to grow our database
		with many courses so each player that visit a course in our database will have a memory 
		for playing at that course. With the golf stat recorder, you can create a player account,
		upload a Scorecard, view the courses available in our database, view players who have created
		accounts, and view Scorecards in our system for each player who have played at a course we support.  <p>
